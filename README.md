# An Eagler client in the browser
Like my serverless client, this is 1.5.2 and may or may not be updated.
There is full support for both singleplayer and multiplayer, though the latter is still in development.

Fork this repo and deploy it if it gets blocked.

# Running a multiplayer server
1) Download this repo (the Java folder is what you need)
2) Run `run.bat` or `run_unix.sh` in both bungee and bukkit folders
3) Open the browser client
4) Connect to ws://127.0.0.1:25565 to play on localhost
